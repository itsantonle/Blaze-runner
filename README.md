## ✨ Features

- 🕹️ **Built with Pygame**  
  Developed using the powerful **Pygame** library—ideal for real-time 2D game development with Python.

- 🏃 **Side-Scrolling Obstacle Runner**  
  A fast-paced scrolling platformer where players must leap over hazards, avoid traps, and stay on the move. Timing and reflexes are everything.

- 🎨 **Hand-Drawn Pixel Art & Frame-by-Frame Animation**  
  All visuals are hand-illustrated and animated pixel by pixel. Every motion—from jumps to collisions—is rendered using detailed frame-by-frame animation for a polished retro aesthetic. 

- 🧩 **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
  The game architecture follows OOP principles in Python, offering clean abstractions, reusable entities (like Player, Obstacles, and Environment), and scalable design for future expansions.
